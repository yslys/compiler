## CS536 SP21 P2
### Contributers
Yuting Yan, Yusen Liu

### Run
```
$ cd $WORKING_DIR
$ make
$ make test
```
### Output
After executing ```$ make test```, the expected output by shell should be as follows:
```
java -cp ./deps:. P2 2> errors.out
diff testAllTokens.out testAllTokensExpect.out
diff testIDTokens.out testIDTokensExpect.out
diff testIntLitTokens.out testIntLitTokensExpect.out
diff testStrLitTokens.out testStrLitTokensExpect.out
diff testEOF.out testEOFExpect.out
diff testCommentEOF.out testCommentEOFExpect.out
diff testBadStrLitEOF.out testBadStrLitEOFExpect.out
diff errors.out errorsExpect.out
```

The output from the shell means that the real output of the test cases match our expected output.

### Files included
- ```cminusminus.jlex```: The JLex specification that defines the behavior of our scanner.
- ```sym.java```: Token definitions that will eventually be generated by the parser generator.
- ```ErrMsg.java```: Used to print error and warning messages.
- ```P2.java```: Contains the main program that tests the scanner.
- ```Makefile```: A Makefile that uses JLex to create a scanner, and also makes P2.class. 

Test cases:
- ```testAllTokens.in```: Test the reserved words, one- or two-character symbols and their combinations. Also includs comments and illegal characters.
- ```testAllTokensExpect.out```: The expected output of testing ```testAllTokens.in```.
- ```testIDTokens.in```: Test the identifiers.
- ```testIDTokensExpect.out```: The expected output of testing ```testIDTokens.in```.
- ```testIntLitTokens.in```: Test the integer literals including bad integer literals.
- ```testIntLitTokensExpect.out```: The expected output of testing ```testIntLitTokens.in```.
- ```testStrLitTokens.in```: test the string literals including unterminated string literals and bad string literals.
- ```testStrLitTokensExpect.out```: the expected output of testing ```testStrLitTokens.in```.
- ```testEOF.txt```: test that your scanner correctly handles an unterminated string literal with end-of-file before the closing quote.
- ```testEOFExpect.out```: the expected output of testing ```testEOF.txt```.
- ```testCommentEOF.txt```: test that your scanner correctly handles an unterminated string literal with end-of-file before the closing quote.
- ```testCommentEOFExpect.out```: the expected output of testing ```testCommentEOF.txt```.
- ```testBadStrLitEOF.txt```: test that your scanner correctly handles an unterminated string literal with end-of-file before the closing quote.
- ```testBadStrLitEOFExpect.out```: the expected output of testing ```testBadStrLitEOF.txt```.
- ```errorsExpect.out```: the expected output of error messages.

All the test cases cover most of the possible cases.

### P2.java
 This program is to be used to test the C-- scanner. This version is set up to test all tokens including input that causes errors, character numbers, values associated with tokens.

 - ```private static void testAllTokens(String fileIn, String fileOut) throws IOException```: this method takes two parameters, of which the first is the test case to read-in, and ```fileOut``` is the output file read by our scanner. 

- ```main```: this function calls ```testAllTokens()``` 7 times that covers all the test cases we provide (described in the previous section). Each time after the function call, ```CharNum.num``` is set to be 1.
